   *Neft.io* runs in all modern browsers and natively in *iOS*, *Android*,
   *Windows Phone*, *BlackBerry*, *Windows*, *OS X*, *Linux* and more.

   No PhoneGap. No HTML. Truly native - gorgeous performance.

3. Server + Client

   Share *back-end* code with the *front-end* for faster development.

   Each part of the *Neft.io* has been designed to work on the server and on the client side.

   With our APIs you only need to point which things should be hidden for the client due to security.

3. View and rendering

   Import your layout just from any *SVG* program (e.g. *Adobe Illustrator*).

   Custom performance-focused *DOM* with high-level *APIs* helps you even faster write
   views in *HTML*.
