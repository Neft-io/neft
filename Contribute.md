Neft is an open-source and fully community project.

Be a part of this community in following ways:

## 1. Report issues

Each bug or missed feature, please report by creating [an issue](https://github.com/Neft-io/neft/issues).

## 2. Help

Be an active member on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neft), [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/neft_io) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Neft-io/neft).

## 3. Teach

Improve API Reference or make Wiki more helpful by preparing a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Neft-io/neft/pulls) with changed source code or proposed wiki document.

## 4. Show

Write examples and publish them on open-source license.

You can try to add them into [official examples](https://github.com/Neft-io/neft/tree/master/examples) if you want to.

## 5. Code

Prepare a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Neft-io/neft/pulls) with a code you want to add into the project.

You can fix a bug, add new [native element](https://github.com/Neft-io/neft/wiki/Default-Styles), write an [extension](https://github.com/Neft-io/neft/wiki/Extensions) or even add support for a new platform!

It's a good practice to always create an [issue](https://github.com/Neft-io/neft/issues) with a bug/feature you are working on.
